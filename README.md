# Problem Solving workshop, 22nd February 2023

## Motivation of the workshop
We, as developers, realized that introducing concept after concept does not work very well, it is simply too abstract. We should begin by describing computer science as "the study of systematic problem-solving".\ 

Computer science is concerned with computation, a phenomenon that affects everyone. It is not just about cell phones, laptop computers, or the Internet. Consider folding a paper airplane, driving to work, preparing a meal, or even transcription of DNA, a process that occurs in your cells millions of times while you are reading this sentence.\

These are all examples of computation, a systematic way of problem solving, even though most people would not perceive them as such.\

A basic understanding of computation thus provides benefits similar to a basic knowledge of physics, chemistry, and biology in making sense of the world and tackling many real-world problems more effectively. This aspect of computation is often referred to as computational thinking.\

[In our second event](https://stsquared.github.io/events/2023/02/20/second-event.html) as the group "She and They do Science and Tech", we organise a workshop focused on helping participants get comfortable with “thinking like a programmer” and use hands-on exercises to explain the principles of problem-solving, computational thinking, and algorithmic.
