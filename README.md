# ProblemSolving_22Feb2023
We as developers realized that introducing concept after concept doesn't work very well; it's simply too abstract. We should begin by describing computer science as "the study of systematic problem-solving".\
Computer science is concerned with computation, a phenomenon that affects everyone. It's not just about cell phones, laptop computers, or the internet. Consider folding a paper airplane, driving to work, preparing a meal, or even transcription of DNA. A process that occurs in your cells millions of times while you are reading this sentence.\
These are all examples of computation, a systematic way of problem solving—even though most people would not perceive them as such.\
A basic understanding of computation thus provides benefits similar to a basic knowledge of physics, chemistry, and biology in making sense of the world and tackling many real-world problems more effectively. This aspect of computation is often referred to as computational thinking.\
[In our second event](https://stsquared.github.io/events/2023/02/20/second-event.html) we planed a workshop focused on helping participants get comfortable with “thinking like a programmer,” and provide modules on problem-solving, computational thinking, and algorithmic exercises.


we recomand you to use these resource to improve your coding skill:\
